============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- Community Resource Pack (0.5.4)

Optional

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Near Future Propulsion before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so. 

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place these engines in a set of nodes located after the stock Ion Propulsion node.

KSP-MINI-AVC
============

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745). 
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent. 
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
